# detect-licence-plate
Diploma project on "license plate recognition on video"


The project consists of four code files. TrainRecognizeCharacters is needed to create a training dataset. The other files are necessary for DetectPlates. To start it, you need to change the path to the video to your own and start DetectPlates. The recognized license plate number will appear in the console. 

The project works only with videos longer than 5 seconds, with good quality and one licence plate
